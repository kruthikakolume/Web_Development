Movie Ticketing System

The movie ticketing system is a critical aspect of the movie industry, and its efficiency can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and revenue. 

The objective of this project is to create a modern and efficient Web Application for movie ticketing system that meets the needs of both the customers and the company. The system should be user-friendly, reliable, and scalable. It should have a responsive and intuitive user interface that allows the two users, admin and customer with the following:
- Admin can manage movie schedules, seat availability, and pricing.
- Customers can book tickets, select seats, view movie schedules and purchase tickets.

To achieve the objectives of the project, Spring Boot and Hibernate technologies will be used to develop the movie ticketing system. Spring Boot provides a fast and easy way to create production-ready applications, while Hibernate provides a high-performance object-relational mapping framework.

The goal is to increase customer satisfaction, improve revenue, and gain a competitive advantage in the market.
